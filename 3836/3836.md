# Issue #3836: Inspect use of `error`

https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3836

We began this work by branching at `77b54c71ca67a759f82872791749fea549ee3bc7`,
committed 18 August 2023.


## Enumerating Files of Interest

Per Mark's advice, I have classified files into two tiers.

The first tier consists of files in the following packages, excluding those used
in testing within those packages:
- `ouroboros-network`
- `ouroboros-network-api`
- `ouroboros-network-protocols`
- `ouroboros-network-framework`

The second tier consists of files in the following packages, excluding those
used in testing within those packages: 
- `cardano-client`
- `cardano-ping`
- `monoidal-synchronisation`
- `network-mux`
- `ntp-client`
- `ouroboros-network-mock`
- `ouroboros-network-testing`

For the moment, we are not focusing on uses of `error` in testing files within
these packages. We consider `error` to be more plausibly useful in testing than
in production code, and its removal to be less necessary. If need be, we can
create a third tier of files consisting of those used in testing across all
packages.

Enumeration of these files is done via the included shell script, `files.sh`.
Its usage is `files.sh (1|2)`, and it prints the location of all calls to error
in the files comprising the command-line-specified tier. It finds these
locations via lightweight semantic analysis (read: `grep`).


## Tier 1

Tier 1 files contain 17 uses of `error`.

### 1: `ouroboros-network/demo/chain-sync.hs:577`
```hs
nextState [] = error "chainSyncServer: impossible"
```

The list on which `nextState` is called originates from `chainGenerator` in the
same file. `nextState` will never see an empty list because `chainGenerator`
creates an infinite list.

As one possible fix, I've replaced the error message with a more informative
one.

As another, I've lifted the `chainGenerator` result into an `Infinite`
construction, courtesy of
[`infinite-list`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/infinite-list-0.1/docs/Data-List-Infinite.html).
If this is too much, the commit introducing it (`1189f40e`) can be reverted.


### 2: `ouroboros-network/src/Ouroboros/Network/PeerSelection/Governor/Types.hs:674`
```hs
error $ "A pick policy requested an attribute for peer address "
     ++ " which is outside of the set given to pick from"
```

This use of `error` appears in `pickPeers`, which is a "`PickPolicy` wrapper
function". `pickPeers` is provided:
- A `PeerSelectionState` containing i.a. `localRootPeers`,
  `publicRootPeers`, and `knownPeers`
- A `PickPolicy` called `pick`
- A `Set peeraddr` called `available`

A `PickPolicy` is "an action that picks a subset of elements from a [collection]
of peers". It makes this choice by examining each peer in this collection and
examining them via several functions (generally of the shape `peeraddr -> _`) it
is provided.

`pickPeers` provides `pick`, its `PickPolicy`, with functions of its own
creation. Those functions check their input peer for membership in
`localRootPeers`, `publicRootPeers`, and `knownPeers`, and trigger the error if
the peer is not found in `knownPeers`, but `pick` will only ever apply them to
peers in `available`. Therefore, the error may be triggered if a peer in
`available` is not in `knownPeers` (i.e. if `available` is partially disjoint
from `knownPeers`).

In practice, `available` appears to be constructed from the various peer
collections in a `PeerSelectionState`, whose invariant (as described in
`assertPeerSelectionState` in this same module) ensures that `knownPeers` is a
superset of all other peer sets, so this error is quite unlikely to be triggered
as long as any extant `PeerSelectionState` adheres to its invariant.

I've added documentation at this `error` site of the rationale I've derived, and
have included a reference to the invariant-documenting function at the
declaration site of `PeerSelectionState`.

I've also added a precondition that checks whether `available` is a subset of
`knownPeers`. This may offer a poor utility to expense ratio in practice, and
I'd welcome input and discussion on this change.

### 3: `ouroboros-network/src/Ouroboros/Network/PeerSelection/Governor.hs:544`
```hs
-- impossible since guardedDecisions always has something to wait for
error "peerSelectionGovernorLoop: impossible: nothing to do"
```

The comment is correct, but I will elaborate on why.

`guardedDecisions`'s result is of type `Guarded`:
```hs
data Guarded m a =
    GuardedSkip !(Maybe (Min Time))
  | Guarded' !(Maybe (Min Time)) (FirstToFinish m a)
```

`Guarded` has a `Semigroup` instance:
```hs
instance Alternative m => Semigroup (Guarded m a) where
  Guarded'    ta a <> Guarded'    tb b = Guarded'    (ta <> tb) (a <> b)
  Guarded'    ta a <> GuardedSkip tb   = Guarded'    (ta <> tb)  a
  GuardedSkip ta   <> Guarded'    tb b = Guarded'    (ta <> tb)  b
  GuardedSkip ta   <> GuardedSkip tb   = GuardedSkip (ta <> tb)
```

Note that the presence of any `Guarded'`-constructed value in a `<>` operation
dominates - that is, will guarantee a `Guarded'`-constructed value. 

Here, "something to wait for" means "a `Guarded` value constructed via
`Guarded'` rather than `GuardedSkip`. `guardedDecisions` constructs a `Guarded`
value by concatenating (via `<>`) several `Guarded` values. At least one of
these values is always constructed via `Guarded'`:
`Ouroboros.Network.PeerSelection.Governor.Monitor.connections`. (In fact,
several others are as well.) The presence of this value guarantees that
`guardedDecisions` produces a `Guarded'` value - i.e., "something to wait for".

Either way, I have pushed the error down to `guardedDecisions`, by exposing an
API to its behavior that promises a non-`GuardedSkip` value.
